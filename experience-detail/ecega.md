# Software Developer Intern
**Ericsson** - Leading Provider of Information and Communication Technology
Jan 2022 - Jul 2022
<br>

**Network Caching Issues and Performance Enhancement:**
<br>

- **Analyzing Existing Algorithms:** Examined algorithms for caching and data handling, identified bottlenecks, and inefficiencies impacting system performance. Focused on algorithms involving hash maps and arrays to improve lookup times and reduce latency.


- **Implementing Optimization Techniques:** Applied techniques such as reducing time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n) by optimizing sorting algorithms. Improved data structures by replacing linear searches with binary search trees and hash tables.


- **Collaboration:** Worked closely with the ISP collaboration team to ensure optimized algorithms aligned with network requirements and enhanced user experience. Coordinated with ISP partners to implement and test these optimizations.

<br>

**Crash Reporting System:**
<br>

- **Development:** Led the design and implementation of an advanced crash reporting system using Python for backend development. Utilized libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data handling and analysis.


- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed crash data to identify underlying issues, using statistical methods and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Debugged and refined code based on analysis results.


- **Outcome:** Achieved a 35% improvement in application stability and service quality by identifying and resolving frequent crash causes.
<br>

**Incident Management and Automation:**
<br>

- **Incident Tracking:** Managed Break & Fix incidents in partnership with OEM vendors and ISPs, using tools like OTRS, MITo, and FTAR for incident management. Maintained detailed logs and records of each incident.

- **Automated Communication:** Developed scripts to automate initial communications with ISPs for incidents. Used Python's smtplib for email automation, streamlining the process and minimizing response times.
<br>

**Data Extraction and Reporting:**
<br>

- **Script Development:** Created Python scripts to automate data extraction from service management tools and databases. Used SQL queries for data retrieval and integrated with Pandas for data manipulation.

- **Reporting:** Designed comprehensive reports to analyze trends in incidents, using tools like Tableau for visualization and reporting. Provided actionable insights to management for improving operational efficiency.
<br>

**Collaboration in Agile Environment:**
<br>

- **Team Collaboration:** Worked closely with the **Facebook Network Appliance** team in an Agile development environment. Participated in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to ensure effective communication and project progress.

- **Issue Resolution:** Diagnosed and resolved critical software issues using Ericsson service management tools. Implemented fixes and improvements, resulting in a 10% reduction in system downtime over six months.
<br>

- **Outcome:** Gained valuable skills in incident management, algorithm optimization, and ISP collaboration, contributing significantly to maintaining system stability and enhancing performance. This role developed technical skills in software development, incident management, and data analysis, making a well-rounded candidate for future software engineering positions.
