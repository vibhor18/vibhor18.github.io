<br>

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
<br>

- **Python-Based Analytics:** Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets exceeding 100 GB.


- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Enhanced data-driven decision-making efficiency by 10% through advanced analytics and insights derived from large datasets. Focused on identifying key trends and patterns to inform strategic decisions.

<br>

**Breast Cancer Diagnosis Models:**
<br>

- **Classification Models:** Developed and analyzed classification models, including K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression, using Scikit-learn to handle cytopathology data.


- **Accuracy Improvement:** Achieved SVM’s highest accuracy rate of 97.2% for breast cancer diagnosis by fine-tuning hyperparameters and employing cross-validation techniques. Improved the reliability of medical diagnostic processes through rigorous model validation.

<br>

**Price Prediction Model:**
<br>

- **Regression Model:** Designed and implemented a linear regression model using Python's Scikit-learn for price prediction on GitHub’s Appstore games data. Applied feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful game features.

- **Feature Analysis:** Analyzed game features as independent variables and app prices as dependent variables, leading to a 15% improvement in price prediction accuracy. Employed data preprocessing methods, such as normalization and encoding, to enhance model performance.

<br>

- **Outcome:** Gained extensive experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world data analytics challenges. This role significantly improved my skills in Python programming, model development, and data analysis, contributing to better decision-making processes and predictive accuracy in various applications.
