#  Predicting Probability of Default for Banca Massiccia
A machine learning solution designed to enhance credit risk assessment by predicting the one-year probability of default (PD) for borrowers using real-world financial data.
<br>


## Project Description:
The Predicting Probability of Default for Banca Massiccia project leverages advanced financial modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze borrowers' financial statements and classify their default risk. The solution is built on XGBoost, with distinct models for new and recurring firms, ensuring precision by incorporating financial ratios, growth features, and industry-specific insights. Custom conditional probability bins improve resolution, and rigorous calibration aligns predictions with real-world scenarios.

The project demonstrates a systematic approach to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, achieving a robust ROC AUC score of 0.819. It includes a custom harness function for seamless integration with future data.
