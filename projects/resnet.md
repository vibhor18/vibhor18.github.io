#  Custom ResNet for CIFAR-10 Image Classification
Designed and developed a Custom Residual Network (ResNet) architecture optimized for the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset, achieving high accuracy with low parameter count.
<br>

## Project Description:

The Custom ResNet for CIFAR-10 project focuses on designing a highly efficient and accurate Residual Network (ResNet) architecture for image classification. The custom ResNet model is optimized to maintain a low parameter count, not exceeding 5 million trainable parameters. Architectural enhancements, such as adjustments to layer depth and filter sizes, were implemented to achieve a balance between model complexity and accuracy. Advanced training techniques, including hyperparameter tuning, optimizers like AdamW, and learning rate schedulers, were employed to stabilize and accelerate training. Extensive data augmentation strategies, such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and rotation, were utilized to improve model generalization and robustness against overfitting. This project demonstrates a high-performance image classification model tailored for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
